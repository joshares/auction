// Getting a complimentary auction estimate from one of our specialists is the first step in the auction process:
// Submit clear colour photographs of up to six items through our online request form
// Provide additional information such as dimensions, materials and history
// Auction estimates are provided in 3–4 weeks for items for which Christie’s has a category of sale and which meet our minimum consignment value. If you have more than six items that you would like valuing, please contact our Estates, Appraisals and Valuation Services.

// Once we have determined that your item is appropriate for auction, our specialists will discuss the location and auction date with you to ensure the strongest bidding.
